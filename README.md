# XP-CRAFT
## Lifesteal, but with XP.
### Every 10 levels, one heart is added to your max health
### As experience drops on death, this works out to be somewhat like Lifesteal, except hearts cannot be destroyed as XP is an infinite source
### To prevent people getting huge amounts of hearts, I didn't do anything because after like 7 hearts it can take DAYS to get a single one, and while you're AFK someone might just kill ya.
